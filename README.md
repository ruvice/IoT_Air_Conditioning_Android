## About Me
This is the Android App for the IoT Air Conditioning System. It is created for CZ4171, and for my overheating Android phone that is now out of commission :(

### Brief Description
It receives RSSI signals from BLEs positioned around the house and sends the signals to the backend, hosted on Azure.
